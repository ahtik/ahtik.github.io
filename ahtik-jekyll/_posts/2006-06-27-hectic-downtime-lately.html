Sorry about recent crazy downtimes at ahtik.com/blog. Hosting company (hub.org) had hardware problems with their mysql servers and they were not able to fix this in a reasonable time. Currently they are using a different server that is under heavy load so site should be ok but response time might vary. Hopefully everything is back in stable within a few days. If not, I'm switching. $11.99 for a root ssh access, unlimited domains and almost restrictionless software installation within 1G storage etc was anyway too good to be true :) Have fun!
