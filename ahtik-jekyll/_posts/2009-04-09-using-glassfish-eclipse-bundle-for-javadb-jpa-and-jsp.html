<p><b>Have you ever wondered how quickly one could get from installing a J2EE server to running a JSP page that fetches data from DB using modern persistency technology like JPA?</b></p>

<p>To find out we (me and <a href="http://meikas.com">Ivar</a>) did a little test-drive using recently announced <a href="http://download.java.net/glassfish/eclipse/">Glassfish Eclipse Bundle</a> that contains Eclipse IDE with bundled Glassfish J2EE server, optionally JDK and a lot of integrated plugins to get you started quickly.</p>

<p>After cutting out all the downloading, startup etc delays we ended up with a surprisingly short 10min demonstration! It was interesting that we barely wrote any code or XML -- see for yourself! Tricky part was initial setup to get all the jars and configurations right -- must be followed pretty much the same sequence as in the video!</p>

<p>Ok, here it comes, have fun :) Probably adding a few annotations and audio would help?</p>
