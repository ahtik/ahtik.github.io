<p><i>"You will come across many opportunities to geek out. This stuff is fascinating at every level of abstraction. But the same curiosity and desire for mastery that helped you succeed as a programmer will now lure you into burning massive amounts of time if you allow yourself to dick around. Every new problem domain will attempt to seduce you with its beautiful, chess-like subtlety. You have to ignore this and respond by playing checkers."</i></p>
