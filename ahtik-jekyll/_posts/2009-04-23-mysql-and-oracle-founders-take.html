Nice reading about MySQL future at Oracle is available at <a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/04/to-be-free-or-not-to-be-free.html">Michael Widenius blog</a>. He is the founder of MySQL, was involved in successfully transferring MySQL business to Sun and left the company in the beginning of 2009.
