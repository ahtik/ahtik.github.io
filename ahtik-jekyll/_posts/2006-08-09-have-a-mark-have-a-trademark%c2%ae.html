Protecting the name of your software is not that expensive as you might think.

Quoting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.patentpending.com/tmark.html">http://www.patentpending.com/tmark.html</a>
<span class="text">"Cost on a simple application is $875 <strong>including</strong> the $325 U.S.                Patent Office fee. Your only other cost will occur about six to                nine months later if we have to amend your application due to a                request for an amendment or office action from the Patent Office.                "</span>

It remains unclear wether it's a one state, U.S. or includes international registration. Any ideas?

Protecting your trademark will always be a choice but if your stakes are high or just trying to get additional VC funding then protecting your trademark should be worth the money.

Think how valuable is PorscheÂ®, literally :)

I'm not urging you to protect every .com domain you have :D
Btw, how many .com domains do YOU have?
