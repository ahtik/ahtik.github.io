<p><b>I'm happy to announce the availability of BPMN2 Modeler update site supporting Indigo!</b></p>


<p>Update site URL: <a href="http://codehoop.com/bpmn2/">http://codehoop.com/bpmn2/</a><br/>
<i>It's an update site, not a website! See <a href="https://github.com/imeikas/BPMN2-Editor-for-Eclipse/wiki">https://github.com/imeikas/BPMN2-Editor-for-Eclipse/wiki</a> for the website.</i></p>

<p>In addition to fixing the code to support Indigo, also Graphiti framework was upgraded from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0. Update includes a few other minor tweaks, nothing major.</p>

<h2>About project future and hosting</h2>
<p>As some of you might know <a href="http://eclipse.org/proposals/soa.bpmn2-modeler/">BPMN2 Modeler proposal</a> got accepted as an eclipse.org project, named <a href="http://eclipse.org/projects/project.php?id=soa.bpmn2-modeler">soa.bpmn2-modeler</a> (yay!!!), so the migration is already on the way. But until that gets finished the latest update site will remain available at <b>http://codehoop.com/bpmn2/</b>. Github repo will become inactive as the git.eclipse.org gets up to full speed.</p>

<p><b>Please note that while Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler offers one of the most complete BPMN2.0 modeling support in the industry, it's still a prototype and is not recommended for production use!</b></p>
