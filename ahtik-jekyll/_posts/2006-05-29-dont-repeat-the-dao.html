<a target="_blank" href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-genericdao.html">Don't repeat the DAO!:</a> "With the adoption of Javaâ„¢ 5 generics, the idea of a generic typesafe Data Access Object (DAO) implementation has become feasible. In this article, system architect Per Mellqvist presents a generic DAO implementation class based on Hibernate. He then shows you how to use Spring AOP introductions to add a typesafe interface to the class for query execution."
