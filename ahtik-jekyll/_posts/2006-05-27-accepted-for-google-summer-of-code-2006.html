<blockquote>Congratulations! This email is being sent to inform you that your application was accepted to take part in the Summer of Code.</blockquote>
My project:  "<a title="Bugzilla item" target="_blank" href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35779">Text Viewer and Editor needs to support word wrap</a>" for <a title="Eclipse.org" href="http://www.eclipse.org">eclipse</a>.

I invite you to be my reader - especially if you know or want to know about eclipse platform inner-life!

Are you a SOC-developer working with eclipse? Please contact me if interested in knowledge-sharing!

My tiny diary is going to be especially useful for those who have never written anything FOR eclipse platform (not IN). As this is my first such, you can learn a lot and leave mistakes for me :)

Current progress is posted within 24 hours - stay tuned!

PS. I added all known Google Summer of Code (SOC 2006) accepted developers blogs to my blogroll for easy reference. Mail me if you've been left out or would like to be called with another name in this link-list.

Congratulations to everyone@SOC and have fun!
