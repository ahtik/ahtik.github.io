<p><b>Aren't you annoyed by the beep that is so loud?</b></p>

<p>I got pretty frustrated after trying to look for disablement under volume control preferences. Nothing there. Also turning off all sound notifications at control panel (including Exclamation sound) didn't help.</p>

<p>Still nothing, just one aloud beep.</p>

<p><b>Here's the quickest way I found to disable it:</b></p>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Go to My Computer
<li> rightclick for Properties
<li> tab Hardware
<li> button Device Manager
<li> menu View
<li> set checkbox Show Hidden Devices
<li> navigate to Non-Plug and Play drivers
<li> open Beep
<li> tab Drivers
<li> button Stop
<li> combo Disabled
<li> button OK
<li> Congratulations!
</ol>
