CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations are the basic functions of most data storages. It's all you need to get your data into any required state. The same concept can be applied to development process as well.

<strong>Following combines all aspects of your product development:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>CREATE - Focus on delivering!</li>
	<li>READ - Focus on listening your customers, developers and yourself!</li>
	<li>UPDATE - Focus on transferring your "readings" into products!</li>
	<li>DELETE - Abandon when no-one is listening to you!</li>
</ul>
You could name this list as DLTA (Deliver, Listen, Transfer, Abandon) but it's far from being as cool as CRUD!
