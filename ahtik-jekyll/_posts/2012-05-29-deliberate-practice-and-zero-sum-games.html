The way to guarantee wealth is to squeeze a potential cumulative effect into as many hours as possible.

Doing X for $Y without using X for a potential income in the future becomes a zero-sum game.

This potential income can come from anything that gets squeezed out from the project -- writing a tutorial based on the last web design project, kicking off an opensource project to combine the reusable parts.

For me it's a hard discipline to follow and takes some creativity but it does sound like a good deliberate practice.
