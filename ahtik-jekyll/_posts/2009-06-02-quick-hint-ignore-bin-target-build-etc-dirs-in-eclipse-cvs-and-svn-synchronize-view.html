<p><strong>Directory ignore feature for svn and cvs in Eclipse Synchronize View is located in a straightforward place but still from time to time we tend to forget. I keep looking at SVN settings and synchronize View Menu but it is not there.</strong></p>

<p>Here it comes:</p>

<p><strong>Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Team-&gt;Ignored Resources</strong><br />
Faster is to simply type "ignored" into preferences quick search!</p>



<p>Here you can add patterns like "bin", "build", "target" etc so these will be ignored.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this kind of ignore patterns are not conceptually correct -- ignored resources should be configured at the svn repository meta-info level!</p>
