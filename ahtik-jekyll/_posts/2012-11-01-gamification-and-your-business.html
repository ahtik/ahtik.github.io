We all work for that pile of cash that is presumably falling at the doorstep after a few years of mad work and sweat. Alright, even if you are not "that guy" but working on your 6th book hoping that maybe this time it's an overnight success: the story stays the same. The waiting for long-term goals are.. long. We get tired. At least I do and I tend to lie to myself: this big plan is the thing giving me the adrenaline rush and smile to the face.

Here's hack on how to stay sane and stay challenged each day.
and keep changing the world long-term while still going to sleep at night feeling that you just did change the world for yourself.

fortunately building a company has very similar characteristics to the successful games.

Successful games work on two levels: 1) short-term adrenaline rush from completing small challenges. 2) long-term mission to keep the planet safe and get rid of that GLaDOS guy.

Unless you wanna be that flash-site-penguin-throwing company keep your motivation high by building short-term levels that keep you feeling progress.
