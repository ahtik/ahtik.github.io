Be aware that when adding new jira source to Mylar with HTTPS protocol then you MIGHT get error saying host not found or wrong username&password.

The reason for this could be missing certificate in your trusted keystore.

<strong>Here's how to fix it:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Run: openssl s_client -connect your.secured.host.com:https</li>
	<li>Copy-paste certificate from previous output to text-file (for example /tmp/key2trust.pem).
Be sure to include BEGIN and END CERTIFICATE rows!!</li>
	<li>Run: keytool -import -alias your.secured.host.com -keystore
/home/ahtik/.eclipsekeystore -file /tmp/key2trust.pem</li>
	<li>Edit eclipse.ini in eclipse home dir to have -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/home/ahtik/.eclipsekeystore</li>
	<li>Start Eclipse and be sure to run with Java 5!</li>
	<li>Let me now if it didn't help.</li>
</ol>
