Greetings from Mountain View, Google HQ in California!

Summit is on and sessions scheduled. There is a lot of fun going on and I'll try to get some of it here, stay tuned!

I'm here representing Eclipse Foundation as one of the organizations participating in Google Summer of Code.
Eclipse had a lot of strong summer of code projects this year and 20 out of 22 projects succeeded, have a look at http://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2008 for more information.

In addition to me there are Markus Alexander Kuppe and Steffen Pingel from Eclipse and there has already been quite a lot of blending with orgs like Blender, K3D, opensuse etc :)

best regards,
Ahti
