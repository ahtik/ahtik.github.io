Today Google has it's 8th birthday! According to search engine logo.

<strong>CONGRATS!</strong>
These guys have definitely changed my life. Participation in Summer of Code is unforgettable because of the people I've met and the experience I've got. Just amazing. My adsense account is still in it's early $thirties but who cares, I'm not doing this because of money.<a target="_blank" href="http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/" />

<a target="_blank" href="http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/">Google Image Labeler</a> is something that has cause more addiction for me than any other online game available. It is still a game, isn't it?
