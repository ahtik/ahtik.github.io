Two faces -- good enough.

Less bias! <a href="http://stephenrobertmorse.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/eurostartups/">EU people work less? Americans work more?</a> Hah, I'm not going to invest in your US startup because many Americans have a gun. Come on.

You can start wherever you want. All it matters is taxes, legals and location of your Intellectual Property.
It is not smart to trap your IP in US. Whenever you want to take it to another country, taxes apply.
Physical location matters mostly for hiring!

Location, Location? No Location!
SV is *not* a mythical dating site where everybody collects the partners and energy.

IRC and IM is closer than you think. Use Skype while you can, there will be more ads than you think, charging SkypeOut is not what is going to make them profit.

Do you think if the relevance of location becomes bigger or smaller? Of course smaller.
I'm not saying that you don't need face to face contact. I'm saying you need it less often than you think.

Corporate Residency vs Legal jurisdiction.

The same goes for VC. Do you think startups need more or less money today? Of course less. So VC is not about Venture Capital.
New VC is now your Experience and Exposure Capital. Network, 
Face it -- 80% of successful exits are "acquhire" with an extra. Would be foolish to ignore.

Still. You should move.
But only for the friends who can challenge you and whom you're worth challenging.
