<p><b>Configuring JavaHL for Eclipse is not as straightforward as it could be so posting a quick HOWTO. Following applies mostly to Linux users.</b></p>
<p>With Ubuntu the fool-proof steps are:
<ol>
<li>Make sure <b>libsvn-java</b>, <b>subversion</b> and <b>libsvn1</b> packages are installed</li>
<li>Add following to the end of your eclipse.ini file: -Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/jni
<li>Restart eclipse and make sure JavaHL is selected under Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Team-&gt;SVN</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>By using JavaHL it gets more likely that your svn repo doesn't get screwed up when using both command-line/shell and subclipse for svn.</p>
