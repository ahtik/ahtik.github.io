<b>How many of you use java.text.SimpleDateFormat as static field?</b>

I have seen this to be pretty standard practice (and have done this myself too).

Be aware that SimpleDateFormat#format(..) <b>is not thread-safe</b> and thereby for most of the cases you should not use this as a static field in server, Eclipse RPC or any other multi-threaded environment.

SimpleDateFormat is internally using field "calendar" that is set with each #format(...) method call so that pretty much breaks the thread-safety.
