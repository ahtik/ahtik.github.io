For now, following decision-points have been discovered for <strong>soft wrap</strong>:
<ul>
	<li>Enable wrapping: is it File or System-wide Setting?
Good would be to have file-specific setting and add global option for newly opened files.
Should the state of wrap-mode restored after reopening file with editor? If yes then how to reset this option globally without making user-interface crappy and unintuitive.Quick-start: I would try to make it system-wide and later refactor it into an indivudual file editor configuration settings. Makes sense?</li>
	<li>Wrap indentation: two choices: simple wrap that starts at every row beginning; smart wrap for java code that takes into account eclipse code formatting rules about proper indentation.Quick-start: Makes sense to start with simple wrap and later introduce extension point to enable wrapping rules to be taken from eclipse formatting plugin.</li>
</ul>
Explanation: Hard wrap is storing line-breaks in file. Soft wrap is just an editor capability to wrap long lines.

<strong>What are your ideas about word-wrap? How do you expect it to behave in eclipse?</strong>

<strong>UPDATE!! Please check <a href="http://ahtik.com/blog/2006/06/18/first-alpha-of-eclipse-word-wrap-released/">this entry</a> for </strong><strong> initial alpha-release! (damaged line numbers etc when turning on but everything is restored after turning wrap off again).</strong>
