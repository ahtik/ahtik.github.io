To keep you in loop, I have now:
<ul>
	<li>reorganized blog categories,</li>
	<li>removed summerofcode 2006 blogroll,</li>
	<li>removed recent comments and trackbacks menuitems,</li>
	<li>added rotating quotes, hand-picked :)</li>
	<li>replaced hard-to-use search form with google search</li>
</ul>
Site looks a lot cleaner now :)

Let's see where do we get with this now, I really hope to find more readers as I'm going to put more time into this blog and writing in general.
