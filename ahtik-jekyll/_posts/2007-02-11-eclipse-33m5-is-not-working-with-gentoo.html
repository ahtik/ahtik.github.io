<strong>At least not for me and at least not out of box using package from download.eclipse.org: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?r=1&protocol=http&file=/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.3M5-200702091006/eclipse-SDK-3.3M5-linux-gtk.tar.gz">eclipse-SDK-3.3M5-linux-gtk</a> :)</strong>

ahti@ahtuxhome /opt/eclipse-SDK-3.3M5 $ ./eclipse
* run-java-tool is not available for sun-jdk-1.6 on i686
* IMPORTANT: some Java tools are not available on some VMs on some architectures

This problem is with any JRE and nichoj from #gentoo-java seems to have a pretty good explanation:
"At some point, it must be trying to be smart, and figure out what /usr/bin/java points to, and trying to invoke that. Which does point to run-java-tool,but that shouldn't be invoked directly."

To run your gentoo box with the latest and most amazing milestone ever please cajole your gentoo-beauty with following:

<strong>./eclipse -vm $(java-config --java)</strong>
