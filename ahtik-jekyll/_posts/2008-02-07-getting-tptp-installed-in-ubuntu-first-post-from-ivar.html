<b>One of the <a href="http://www.codehoop.com">Codehoopers</a> started to blog about <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/">programming</a>, welcome aboard! :)</b>

As he doesn't have much readers yet I guess it's ok to point to his first post: <a href="http://meikas.com/blog/2008/tptp-and-ubuntu/">Eclipse TPTP and Ubuntu"</a>

It's about getting TPTP running. Especially under Linux. Don't underestimate the complexity of this - it's not that easy :)

Nice post, thank you!

PS. Some old-time readers might remember that Ivar has been featured at this blog also before - <a href="http://ahtik.com/blog/2007/04/11/four-is-the-magical-number-and-so-is-5920/">Four is the Magical Number - and so is 5920</a>.
