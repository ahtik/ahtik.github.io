<strong>From unknown and unverified sources (IM chat, thanks Raul!):</strong>

iPhone is less than a half-inch thin -- less than almost any phone on the market today. It comes with a 2-megapixel digital camera built into the back, as well as a slot for headphones and a SIM card. The phone is 11.6 millimeters thick with a 3.5-inch-wide touchscreen and a 2-megapixel camera. The device integrates functions of Apple's popular iPod music and video players and has 4 or 8 gigabytes of storage.
