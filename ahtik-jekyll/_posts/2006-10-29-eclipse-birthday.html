Eclipse is 5 years old! Just about month ago Google got 8. Who could have thought that Eclipse is younger than Google!

Help us to spread the word and sign your Eclipse greeting card at <a href="http://birthday.eclipse.org/images/map.php?individual">eclipse birthday central</a>.

There are eclipse-funded parties all over the world, find your local from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipsebirthday5/birthdayparties.php">http://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipsebirthday5/birthdayparties.php</a>

Unfortunately November is very busy for me so very likely there is no official eclipse birthday party in Estonia.

Just a pint of Guinness with friends.
