Did you knew that if you have ant build.xml in eclipse Ant view then you can refresh your eclipse workspace simply using:
<blockquote>
	&lt;eclipse.convertPath filesystempath="${basedir}" property="resource.basedir"/&gt;
	&lt;eclipse.refreshLocal resource="${resource.basedir}" depth="one"/&gt;
</blockquote>
?

Very handy for build scripts to make sure eclipse resources are in sync after the build.

Thanks to Roland for the tip!
