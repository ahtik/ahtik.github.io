<p><b>Soon to  be released jBPM5.1 is getting a new addition to its product suite - visual editor for the BPMN2 language. This was somewhat inevitable as the jBPM workflow engine moves to BPMN2.0 with the version 5 and hacking together xml files without visual guidance can be.. hmm.. less fun.</b></p>


<p>For a quick background, <a href="http://www.bpmn.org/">BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation)</a> is the leading standard for business process modeling managed by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/">OMG</a>. A new version called <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/">BPMN2.0</a> (released January 2011) brings numerous changes to the table, most importantly increasing the consistency and integrating orchestration and choreography in a way that makes BPMN 2.0 a great choice for business process engines.</p>

<p>Over the past few months <a href="http://codehoop.com">we</a>'ve been very excited to work on a new <a href="https://github.com/imeikas/BPMN2-Editor-for-Eclipse/wiki">BPMN2.0 Visual Editor for Eclipse</a>. It is free and open source, <a href="https://github.com/imeikas/BPMN2-Editor-for-Eclipse">hosted at github</a>. This github repo is a temporary place and will find a new home soon.</p>

<p>BPMN2 Editor is built on top of the awesome <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/graphiti/">Graphiti modeling framework</a> and behind the scenes uses <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/MDT-BPMN2">BPMN2 EMF metamodel</a>.</p>

<p>For more details check out the <a href="http://kverlaen.blogspot.com/2011/02/new-bpmn-20-eclipse-editor.html">more detailed post about the BPMN2.0 visual editor</a> by Kris from jBPM.</p>

<p>Check it out, have fun, contribute, report issues and bear in mind that it's still beta and actively developed ; )</p>
