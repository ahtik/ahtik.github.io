<a href="http://tom.jabber.ee/chessblog/">Toomas</a> finished the official part of the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007">google summer of code</a> program. It was an honor to be the mentor and I had/still have a lot of fun with him.

Grab <a href="http://tom.jabber.ee/phpengine/update-site/">The PHP writing plugin for Eclipse from the update site</a> and check it out if it works for you!

Sorry, but java6 and eclipse 3.3 only! (jsr-223 scripting engine starts from java 6)

Quercus GPL-licensed PHP Fragment is not mandatory - the plugin supports also javascript (and possibly all JSR223 scripting engines).

Have fun and let him know if you find some cool usage for it. Commenting at <a href="http://tom.jabber.ee/chessblog/">his blog</a> is a good start.
I had to disable comments at my blog :(

A cool feature would be to write a small snippet that sends selected text to some rafb/etc pastebin and prints the url to the eclipse console view.
