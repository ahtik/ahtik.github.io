[8:40:38 PM] Michael Herzog: I vote for HTML5 - please save us from the micro Apps

[8:57:08 PM] Ahti Kitsik: "re: monetization". hypothetically if html5 wins over appstore apps google & apple might have monopoly for e-wallet and can monetize even from the off-store apps.
[8:58:47 PM] Ahti Kitsik: i.e. distribution becomes more distributed but the monetization parties remain the same due to the user usability friction.

but monopoly is needed in order to provide reasons for staying in the market.

app developers are essentialy doing high-frequency trading. a/b and flood the market.
