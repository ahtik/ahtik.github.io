<strong>Me and Ivar just came up with a new way to attack bugs - we formed a fight club!</strong>

<strong>You can join us if you follow the rules!</strong>

<font size="+1">1st RULE: You do not talk about FIGHT CLUB.</font>

<font size="+1">2nd RULE: You DO NOT talk about FIGHT CLUB.</font>

<font size="+1">3rd RULE: If someone says "stop" or goes limp, taps out the bugfix is over.</font>

<font size="+1">4th RULE: Only two guys to a bugfix.</font>

<font size="+1">5th RULE: One bugfix at a time.</font>

<font size="+1">6th RULE: No shirts, no shoes.</font>

<font size="+1">7th RULE: Bugfixes will go on as long as they have to.</font>

<font size="+1">8th RULE: If this is your first night at FIGHT CLUB, you HAVE to fix bugs!</font>
