<p><b>The breakthrough for me came when I realized that the laser sharp focus is not about focus itself. It's about taking away everything else. I just constantly apply deliberate practice to eliminate aspects that ruin focus.</b></p>

<p>It's always about distractions. At home you might have a good idea about the goods to take from the grocery but as soon as you step into the store without a list - you're lost. At least for me managing to remember even five items while looking around in a store is close to impossible.</p>

<p>Working with a computer is like working in a candy store. It's easy to get lost as soon as you forget your current task. To overcome my memory and attention failure I tweaked my <a href="http://timegt.com">task management app TimeGT</a> - now it shows my in progress task as a small always-on-top notification window. It annoys with smaller screens just a bit but at least I remember that I should be working on X and NOT check my e-mail or twitter or read that wicked new CSS button generator source. Keep your current task clearly written somewhere visible, it has helped me way more than I thought.</p>

<p>It is suggested that when procrastination kicks in then it's better to do anything a bit important, even if it's not urgent. It sounds like a good short-term solution but I try to avoid it as much as possible. If there is an important AND urgent task waiting then doing unurgent is not the best thing to do. I better stay calm, go out and take a walk -- clears my mind and helps to reevaluate priorities and motivation. Maybe the urgent task is unimportant and then it should be never done. At least according to the <a href="http://timegt.com/2010/07/14/what-is-the-eisenhower-matrix/">Eisenhower matrix</a>.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Jevgeni <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/hack-yourself-to-prevent-procrastination-information-overload/">for the blog post</a> that sparked the need to write down my own thoughts on this.</p>
