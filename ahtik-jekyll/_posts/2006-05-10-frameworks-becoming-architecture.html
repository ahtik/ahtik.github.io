What's cool about frameworks is how elegantly they add better granularity and decoupled code. At the same time they force you to split one logic/business concept between different layers - dividing your initial business concept by decoupling it in a different dimension.

The best systems are built using great frameworks but the code you write with them is like a DNA molecule that is extremly small+efficient. But watch out! Even a small misconfiguration will produce chihuahuas, string-theorists, disco-music and of course, microsoft.

Final question: Where should one draw the line to differentiate FRAMEWORK and ARCHITECTURE?
