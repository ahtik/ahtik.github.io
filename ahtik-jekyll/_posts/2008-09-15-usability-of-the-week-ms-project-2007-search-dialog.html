<b>How to search for all tasks in MS Project file?</b>

You can't. By default MS Project is searching for only expanded tasks. So it is obvious to expect search dialog to have checkbox for all-nodes search.

But looks like there is no such checkbox so you always have to expand.

Instead of the checkbox the search dialog has pretty much only two combos: "Test:" and "Field:" ("Search:" has just "Up" and "Down") :

Maybe it's just me but they look funny and probably used only for about 0.1% of the searches people do? :)


<b>PS!</b> Should we be worried when project file size suddenly drops from 1MB to 400KB but all information is still there?
