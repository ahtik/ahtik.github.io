<p><strong>What is the smallest change to <i>main</i> method that makes it sysout "true"?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You are allowed to change ONLY the main method! Of course changing sysout line is out of question.</strong></p>

You can leave your answer in comments and I'll publish/approve them together with the solution.

[java]
public class InstanceDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args){
		MyClass cl1 = new MyClass();
		MyClass cl2 = new MyClass();
		System.out.println(cl1.ocl==cl2.ocl && cl1!=cl2);
	}

	private static class MyClass extends java.util.ArrayList {
		private final Object ocl = new Object();
	}

}
[/java]

I'll post the correct answer in 24h :)

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Was not that hard afterall! :) ~45 correct answers.

Yes, clone() was the answer I was looking for:
[java]MyClass cl2 = (MyClass) cl1.clone();[/java]

<a href="http://ed-merks.blogspot.com/">Ed Merks</a> surprised with a nice solution:
[java]
//Add this line as the first line of main.
class MyClass extends InstanceDemo.MyClass {
Object ocl = null;
}
[/java]

And a lot of people took the hard-core way:
[java]
Field field = cl1.getClass().getDeclaredField("ocl");
field.setAccessible(true);
field.set(cl2,cl1.ocl);
[/java]
:)
