Thanks to the ones bugging about posting new stuff. no thanks to my side for not doing this.

summer has been busy yet slow-paced regarding online presence.

ALL Comments are now disabled to prevent spamming. All moderation-queue comments were deleted (sry for the serious ones, over 3000 comments was too much to filter manually).

Yes, this blog gets back to live and kickin'. Maybe! ;)

At least one eclipse-related post is already in draft stage.

AND there's a cool release shortly coming in from one of the Google SoC this year students (khm, yes the one I have the privilege of mentoring).
