There is a good read from Seth Godin about processes and why you don't like them. He has his point.
Worth reading because he's a cool man. I know, I've experienced this.

<!--more-->Bookshelfshop Amazon.com is still not shipping e-books ordered at amazon.com to Estonia because of some copyright restriction (but it ships hard-copies, how stupid is this). Anyway, after complaining about the problem to mr Seth Godin (I was just not able to buy his $25 e-book) he sent me his copy for free just asking to donate this money to charities. How kind is that?

Anyway, here's the post: <a target="_blank" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/04/why_are_you_afr.html">Why are you afraid of process?</a>
