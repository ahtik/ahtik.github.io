          <h2>IntelliJ IDEA goes Open-Source!</h2>
<p class="meta">16 Oct 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p><b>Yesterday (October 15th, 2009) IntelliJ <a href="http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2009/10/intellij-idea-open-source">announced</a> open-sourcing most of its IDEA editor under Apache 2.0 license.</b></p>

<h2>Inevitable for growth</h2>
<p>At some perspective this has been an inevitable move -- code editors have turned into big platforms. They are used for much more than developing pure text-based artifacts. To remain competitive you need to allow the maximum level of integration, openness and visibility. Which becomes impossible without open-sourcing all the core components. Controversially, using a permissive license (ASL, BSD, EPL, LGPL, not GPL) can turn your business into a charity organization.</p>

<h2>Commercial offering</h2>
<p>IDEA Platform plus Java, Groovy and Scala support are all open-sourced. It looks like IntelliJ is retaining some of the revenue stream by keeping Java EE stack closed-source, calling it IDEA Ultimate and offering it as a commercial product.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Java Enterprise (JEE) Tooling</h2>
<p>I think IntelliJ decision about keeping EE as a separate commercial product is a very important indicator for the whole IDE marketplace and particularly for Eclipse. Much to my surprise, at the <a href="http://eclipse.org/membership/slides.pdf">last Eclipse members meeting Q3 call</a> there were some very interesting download stats reported. Eclipse Galileo IDE for JEE gets 41% of the downloads! While Classic and Java combined were 34%! (Off-topic but rcp/plugin edition was 2%).</p>

<p>This 41% of JEE downloads does not include 3rd party distribution providers, many application server vendors have their own bundles with a pre-configured settings (for example <a href="http://download.java.net/glassfish/eclipse">GlassFish Tools Eclipse Bundle</a>).</p>

<h2>Indication for a better future</h2>
<p>IntelliJ move and Eclipse Galileo JEE download clearly demonstrate how important is a good tooling support for Java Enterprise development.</p>

<p>IntelliJ move can also be a sign for Eclipse that there is now a friendly competitor who has put their bet on outperforming current Eclipse JEE feature-set with a commercial offering.</p>

<p>I have no experience with the IntelliJ JEE offering, is it better than the JEE tooling from Netbeans and Eclipse?</p>
